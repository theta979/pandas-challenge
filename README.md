Module 4 challenge

This challenge started off feeling a bit routine but I found that as I was implementing the sample code provided I began to encounter syntax that I was having a difficult time understanding. I also found that as the NoteBook got longer it became more difficult to keep track of DataFrames and variables I had previously declared (especially since I worked on the challenge off and on over several days). So as I began to encounter errors I was a struggle to track down and correct these errors. One that I kept getting was in reference to the "School Size" and "Math Score" in the later sections. I eventually, got the NoteBOok to run without these errors.

Lastly, I tried a method to suppress the deprecation warnings that occur (either in the School Size or School Type section) but ended up commenting that out because I couldn't be sure it wasn't contributing to the issue. There was also some formatting I did early on in the District overview section that I removed and some code that was provided in the skeleton code we reviewed in class to convert spending ranges into a string that I disabled during my attempts to debug.
